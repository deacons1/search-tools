You are tasked with analyzing a SvelteKit + Tailwind CSS application that utilizes Supabase for backend services. Your goal is to identify refactoring opportunities to improve code maintainability. Specifically, aim to find the most impactful ways to simplify the code structure, reduce duplication, and optimize data handling.

Carefully review these files and analyze them for potential refactoring opportunities. Focus on the following areas:

Code Duplication:
Look for repetitive code across components, stores, utilities, or styles that could be abstracted into reusable functions, components, or modules.

Code Structure:
Identify large or complex components, stores, or utility functions that could be broken down into smaller, more focused pieces to enhance readability and maintainability.

Data Handling and Supabase Integration:
Examine any data fetching, state management, or Supabase interactions that could be optimized, such as reducing the number of API calls, centralizing Supabase logic, or improving state synchronization.

Best Practices:
Ensure that the code follows Svelte and SvelteKit best practices, such as leveraging Svelte’s reactive features, using context effectively, adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, and maintaining consistent styling with Tailwind CSS.

After your analysis, identify the top 3 most impactful refactoring ideas. For each idea, briefly describe:

What the current issue is
How you propose to refactor it
The expected benefits of this refactoring
Next, choose the single most impactful refactoring idea from your top 3. Implement this refactoring by modifying the relevant code files. Ensure that your refactoring:

Follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
Maintains or improves code readability
Remains backward-compatible and does not break existing functionality
After implementing the refactoring, provide a brief explanation of:

What changes were made
How these changes improve maintainability
Any potential areas for further refactoring
Additional Considerations:
Remember to consider all aspects of the application architecture, including:

SSR (Server-Side Rendering):
How the refactoring affects server-rendered pages versus client-side interactions.

State Management:
Utilizing Svelte stores or other state management solutions effectively to handle application state.

Supabase Integration:
How the refactoring interacts with Supabase services (authentication, database operations, real-time updates, etc.).

Client-Side Routing:
Ensuring that navigation and routing are handled smoothly without introducing issues.

Tips:

Authentication:
Ensure that all protected routes/components correctly handle authentication states using Supabase.

Tailwind CSS:
Utilize Tailwind CSS effectively to maintain consistent styling while addressing the refactoring needs.

SvelteKit Features:
Leverage SvelteKit’s features, such as endpoints, layouts, and hooks, for optimal performance and scalability.
